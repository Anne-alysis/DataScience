# DataScience
This repository includes a few examples of my data analysis techniques on varying sets of data that I have performed in my spare time, separate from analyses for NIST, Duke University/University of North Carolina, University of Washington, or University of California--Berkeley.  I code primarily in R and Python, though use Fortran and shell scripting as well.  

Each data set is organized into individual branches.  

Additionally, selected academic papers are in the "Academic-papers" branch.  

See https://github.com/Anne-alysis/SFIshare for more intensive recent code written at the Santa Fe Institute Complex Systems Summer School (June-July 2016).
