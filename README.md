# DataScience
This repository includes a few examples of my data analysis techniques (circa 2015) on varying sets of data that I have performed in my spare time, separate from analyses for NIST, Duke University/University of North Carolina, University of Washington, or University of California--Berkeley.  This code base is primarily in R and Python, though use Fortran and shell scripting as well.  

See https://github.com/Anne-alysis/SFIshare for more intensive recent code written at the Santa Fe Institute Complex Systems Summer School (June-July 2016).  Other repos include Python and Scala/Spark analyses of a Game of Thrones league.  

## Critics
This is an analysis of the scoring TV pilots. The report and the code markdown are included.  We watch a handful (~12) of pilots and score based on a number of criteria, then watch full seasons of the top 6.  

## FlightsVsTerrorEvents

This analysis compares flight information for  travel within the United States with terrorist events against aircraft or airports around the world.  A report writeup is included, as well as a markdown of the code to generate the analysis and plots.  

## Academic-papers

Selected academic papers are in the "Academic-papers" directory.
