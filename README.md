# DataScience
This repository includes a few examples of my data analysis techniques on varying sets of data that I have performed in my spare time, separate from analyses for NIST, Duke University/University of North Carolina, University of Washington, or University of California--Berkeley.  

Each data set is organized into individual branches.  

Additionally, selected academic papers are in the "Academic-papers" branch.
